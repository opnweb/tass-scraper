"IN BRIEF: Putin talks to reporters about Oreshnik missile, natural gas transit","Russia could use Oreshnik again if need be, but the country is seeking to end the conflict in Ukraine, the Russian president said",2024-12-26 21:09:18,https://tass.com/politics/1894093,"Russia could use Oreshnik again if need be, but the country is seeking to end the conflict in Ukraine, the Russian president said IGORA /Leningrad Region/, December 26. /TASS/. Russia could use Oreshnik again if need be, but the country is seeking to end the conflict in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters. Russia is ready to continue to supply gas to Europe, according to the president, but Kiev announced that it will not renew the contract. By ending the transit, Ukraine is punishing Europe, although Kiev relies on its support to continue to fight, and even exist, he said. Below are Putin’s key statements that TASS put together. Russia has a few Oreshnik intermediary-range missile systems. There is not many of them. Russia is in no hurry to use them ""because they are powerful weapons that are designed to achieve certain goals."" If need be, ""we will use it, but we are not in a hurry."" Strikes on Russian territory will never go unanswered. ""We always respond in kind. Whenever they use certain weapons against us, we use similar weapons."" Russia is seeking to end the conflict in Ukraine. The number one objective for 2025 is to achieve the goals of the special military operation. Russia will make progress along the engagement line. ""I believe in God, and God is with us."" Back in 2021, US President Joe Biden suggested ""delaying Ukraine's admission to NATO for 10-15 years because it is not yet ready."" Peaceful settlement in Ukraine was the key issue of discussion during Slovak Prime Minister’s Robert Fico’s visit to Moscow. The prime minister expressed readiness to provide his country's territory as a venue for talks between Moscow and Kiev. ""If it comes to that, why not? Because Slovakia holds a neutral position from our point of view."" Russia has always called for depoliticization of economic issues and never hindered gas supplies to Europe. Russia still maintains a transit of at least 14 million cubic meters of gas through Ukraine and pays for it. ""Regardless of the war, our supplies were regular and we paid, and still pay, by the way, money for transit."" Russia is ready to supply gas through Ukraine under a contract with any counterparty, but this is impossible given the lawsuit from Kiev. By halting the transit of Russian gas to Europe, Ukraine is ""pecking"" the hand that feeds it. The Ukrainians are ""punishing Europe"" by closing the contract for the supply of Russian gas. Moscow is also ready to supply gas to Europe through Poland, using the existing Yamal-Europe route. ""All it needs is just pushing a button"". The most important thing in the coming year is ""the well-being of the Russian people, standard of living, stabilityю"" In terms of economy, the goals are to tame inflation and continue economic growth, which will be about 4% in 2024.",russia,10,ukraine,9,gas,7,europe,7,use,6,russian,6,president,4,ready,4,supply,4,kiev,4

""Another example of how such unlawful restrictive measures harm not only and not so much our country was the disruption of the transfer of funds from Russia's voluntary contribution to the budget of the International Committee of the Red Cross,"" the statement said.

The US and Israeli actions in Syria are likely to result in the disintegration of the country and violate the principle of indivisible security, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated in an interview with domestic and foreign media outlets on Thursday. ""We should prevent the Syrian state from fragmenting that some would like to see,"" the Russian top diplomat noted. Lavrov stressed the need to ""address problems in eastern Syria, a significant part of which has been illegally occupied by the US, namely its most fertile lands with the main oil fields."" ""Everything is extracted, exported, and the money goes to support the separatist structures that the US has created in eastern Syria. All of this must be taken into account,"" Lavrov stated. ""Israel should understand its responsibility for shared efforts and abandon any attempts to ensure its security at the expense of the security of others,"" the Russian foreign minister stressed. ""This is a longstanding principle of indivisible security,"" he emphasized. ""One cannot expect that destroying all military facilities of a neighbor will guarantee peace and stability indefinitely.

Ukraine needs to hold elections if it wants a legitimate president — Russia’s top diplomat,"However, Sergey Lavrov noted, the most crucial thing at the moment is to address the root cause of this crisis instead of forming a so-called negotiating team on behalf of the Kiev regime",2024-12-26 14:21:21,https://tass.com/politics/1893785,"However, Sergey Lavrov noted, the most crucial thing at the moment is to address the root cause of this crisis instead of forming a so-called negotiating team on behalf of the Kiev regime MOSCOW, December 26. /TASS/. Ukraine must hold elections if it wishes to have a legitimate president, and as of now, the country’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, is the only legitimate authority in the country, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated on Thursday. ""Regarding the legitimacy of the so-called current Ukrainian government, President [of Russia Vladimir Putin] clearly stated during his recent year-end press conference that Ukrainians should deal with this issue on their own to bring the situation in Kiev in line with the Ukrainian Constitution,"" Lavrov said in an interview with Russian and international media. ""In order to achieve this goal, if they genuinely want a legitimate president, they must hold elections. As of now, and according to the [Ukrainian] Constitution as [Russian President] Putin previously explained, only the Verkhovna Rada and its chairman are legitimate,"" Lavrov added. However, the Russian minister continued, the most crucial thing at the moment is to address the root cause of this crisis instead of forming a so-called negotiating team on behalf of the Kiev regime, because it would be impossible to reach any agreement without resolving the initial issue. ""I have already outlined these root causes in detail, and I truly hope that all those who are interested in advancing the negotiations understand what is at stake,"" Lavrov stated. ""I would like to emphasize that these are not prerequisites, but rather something that all participants involved in this process, this conflict, should have addressed long ago in accordance with the obligations they have already undertaken, including in line with the UN Charter, the principles of which should be rigorously followed,"" he stressed. Russia’s top diplomat pointed out that a temporary ceasefire on the frontline, to be resumed later, is unacceptable. ""We need final, legally binding agreements that will set out conditions for ensuring Russia’s security and, of course, the legitimate interests of our neighbors, but in a manner based on international law, which will make it impossible to violate those agreements,"" he concluded.",lavrov,5,legitimate,5,president,4,russian,4,root,3,called,3,kiev,3,stated,3,ukrainian,3,russia,3
