## üõ†Ô∏è How to use TASS scraper

### 1. Navigate to the scraper folder

First, navigate to the folder where `tass_scraper` is located on your computer, for example:


**On Windows:**
```powershell
cd C:/Users/my-user/projects/tass_news
```
-----


**On macOS:**

```powershell
cd /Users/my-user/projects/tass_news
```
-----
### 2. Run the TASS scraper


Basic usage with default settings _(scrapes 20 news articles from each category)_:
```powershell
./tass_scraper
```
-----

> [!NOTE]
> The scraper outputs data to the same directory from where you ran it. For example, if you run the scraper from `C:/Users/my-user`, the `news_data` folder will be saved in the same path.

Example with custom parameters:
```powershell
./tass_scraper --headlines 50 --categories world politics defense --workers 5 --csv --top-words
```
-----

> [!CAUTION]
> Use a reasonable value for `--workers`. The default is `2` workers, which is good for most tasks. A good rule of thumb is to set workers to the number of CPU cores for optimal performance. Too many workers can overload your system and reduce efficiency. Additionally, TASS **may block your IP address** if you make too many requests per minute.


You can use as many paramters as you need.

If you want to specify your custom folder where to save all the data, you can do it using the `--output-dir` flag, for instance:

```powershell
./tass_scraper --output-dir /Users/my-user/Documents/my-custom-folder
```
